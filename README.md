# Pix
A tiny Paint-like app to draw pixels.

**NOTE**: I originally wrote this app back in 2011. I found the code in my archive, I'm dusting it off and adding features.

## Build
Make sure you have the Java SDK installed. On Ubuntu you can install it like this:
```sh
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk openjdk-21-source
```

Then, compile and run like so:
```sh
javac Pix.java
java Pix
```
